# Sayılar

*Sayılar* (turkish for "numbers") is an app with simple exercises for practicing turkish numbers.


## About

This app will have different simple exercises for practicing recognizing and using turkish numbers.
It aims to be as minimal as possible, as it is only a little side project.
It arose from myself learning turkish and wanting a better way of practicing their numbers.

More information will follow, once the app is in a usable state.
